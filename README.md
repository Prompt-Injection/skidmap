# skidmap
SkidMap short for "script kiddy" and "Nmap," automating tedious reconnaissance with a sophisticated &amp; methodical approach. Starting with a Ping Sweep to identify live hosts, ensuring targeted scans only, and optionally followed by a stealth scan to minimize detection, this tool effectively reduces unnecessary time and noise.
